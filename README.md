# boston-house--project

Based on the file structure shown in the image, this is a linear regression machine learning project implemented in Python to predict housing prices in Boston. The project covers an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preparation, model training, performance evaluation, and model deployment using Flask and Docker. By setting up the Python environment, loading and preprocessing the Boston house price dataset, training and evaluating the linear regression model, serializing the trained model objects using pickle, creating a Flask web application, and writing a Dockerfile to encapsulate the application, we built a complete deployable machine learning solution that can predict house prices from new data through a web interface. The project demonstrates the use of Python to predict house prices. This project demonstrates a standardized development process for solving regression tasks using Python and common machine learning libraries.
